message = Welcome, new personnel, to the Facility! This Facility was built to make all of the world’s scientific advances and record them before releasing it to the public. I am (insert name here), one of the Facility’s Artificial Intelligences. Now, before we get started, here is your card.`^*a tube pops out from the cieling, and it dispenses an ID card* `^This is your IDentification card, keep it on you at all times, or the security system will put in the brig, and force you to pay for a replacement. Advice: you best be hired by a department or create one of your own, what the facility does to interns is more or less terrifying.`^If you have any questions about this facility, the staff, or the growling noise in the vents, please contact our Moderators or the [Secret Subredit Wiki](http://secretsubreddit.wikia.com/wiki/SecretSubreddit_Wiki)
